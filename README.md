# Welcome to My Tetris
***

## Task
The task is to implement the classic Tetris game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game should have the following features:

Allow the player to move and rotate falling Tetrominoes (shapes composed of four square blocks) to fill horizontal lines and clear them from the board.
Increase the player's score as they clear lines and level up as they reach certain score thresholds.
Provide a game over screen when the stack of Tetrominoes reaches the top of the board.

## Description
Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle game where players control falling Tetrominoes to create horizontal lines without any gaps. Once a line is complete, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of Tetrominoes reaches the top of the board, and the player can no longer place any new pieces.

This implementation of Tetris uses JavaScript to handle the game logic, HTML to create the game board, and CSS to style the game elements.

## Installation
To play the game, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the falling Tetrominoes left and right, rotate them, or make them fall faster. The goal is to fill as many horizontal lines as possible without letting the stack of Tetrominoes reach the top of the board. As you clear more lines, your score will increase, and you'll level up. Be careful, though - the game gets faster as you level up! When you can no longer place any new Tetrominoes, the game is over. Good luck!
